# X-Order-Markov-Chain-Procedural-Epithet-Generation
Generating Fantasy Epithets using Markov Chains

## Why
I'm an amateur fantasy writer with a terrible imagination. I need some way to create epithets without working hard. This seems like a good time to use Markov Chains.

## How will this work?
We're going to be using Markov Chains to generate epithets procedurally. If you want to read more about how Markov Chains work, check out this [documentation](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:markov-chain) on Markov Chains.
